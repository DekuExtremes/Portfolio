# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and passion for web development and design. The website features a single-page layout, with sections for my background, skills, and completed projects. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it highlights my creativity, attention to detail, and technical expertise.

## Key Features:
- Sticky Navigation Bar: Easy access to all sections as you scroll through the page.
- Hero Section: Includes a dynamic background video and a bold introduction.
- Projects Section: Displays my recent work, with project images, descriptions, and interactive elements.
- Cursor-Following Animation: A custom blob follows the cursor, adding a fun and interactive touch to the user experience.
- Mobile Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

Feel free to explore the [portfolio](https://dekuextremes.github.io/Portfolio/) and the code behind it. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome!
